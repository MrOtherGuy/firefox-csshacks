/* Makes the bookmarks toolbar scrollable via mouse scroll or scrollbar */

/* allow scrolling */
#PlacesToolbarItems {
    overflow-x: auto !important;
}

/* restore visibility of hidden bookmarks */
.bookmark-item {
    visibility: initial !important
}

/* hide overflow menu */
#PlacesToolbar #PlacesChevron {
    visibility: collapse !important;
}

/* force thin scrollbar */
#PlacesToolbarItems {
    scrollbar-width: thin !important;
}

/*
When the Browser Window reaches a smaller enough width or the amount of Bookmarks overlap the browsers width, overlapping bookmark items are:
1. set as hidden. 
2. duplicated into the overflow menu.

This style is a simple to implement and easily maintained by:
1. enabling scrolling on the toolbar
2. restoring visibility of hidden bookmarks.

You can have both the scrollable toolbar and the overflow menu by removing Line 16-18
